- View user should allow modification of user's/location's values (same for view location)
- Allow drag and drop for assignment of employees to locations
- On employee assignment page, prompt user to submit before they leave if changes are made (depends on 4)

- Limit password attempts
- ENV file for table names, DB info

- Switch PK of locations to email


Q
- Do users need passwords? Simply enter email and get placement? or send placement directly to email?
- Do request objects have default attributes you can set? Should I worry about manual POST requests breaking the app?
    Can I circumvent them by defining what to do if improper information sent with POST request?
- For assignment operations including multiple employees, should I commit every time?
- Better to have relocation operations all in one button? or individual assign/remove?
- Create account from login page?
